            <h3> How can you bring your best and most successful self to work every day?
Told in a series of conversations with Gautam, and interspersed with tales from the Buddha’s life – along with real-life stories from people who’ve faced challenging situations in their jobs – Buddha at Work offers invaluable insight that will guide you through the challenges of the modern-day workplace.
This book unlocks the secrets to:
•
Keeping yourself motivated and energized, and being your productive best;
•
Managing stress and taking control of every workday situation;
•
Dealing with difficult bosses and co-workers or unforeseen situations like losing your job;
•
Channelling negativity into a more productive and positive attitude.
Drawn from the author’s decades of experience as head of HR in the country’s top organizations, and packed with easy-to-apply practical advice, Buddha at Work will help you achieve your true potential and find inspiration when you need it the most.
